        <span class="ewelinkAFSpan">
            1.If you have installed mobile security APP such as Mobile Manager or Mobile Safe Assistant, this kind of APPs may have prohibited some permissions of eWeLink. Sometimes the system will even prompt security warning, thus it leads to a failed search. To solve it, please access to this kind of App, make eWeLink as your trusted App, then go to permission settings, set all eWeLink permissions to Allowed.

If you failed to find ( ITEAD-10000XXXX) or when you enter the password, it says “Wrong Password”, your model may have hardware problem, please contact seller for help.

        <span class="ewelinkAOSpan">
            ② If your model’s pairing led fast blinks 3 times and repeats.Please check if you have enabled “Wireless network internal isolation”. Enabling it will cause the App can’t access the device and failed to search the device. Please disable it.

        <span class="ewelinkAFSpan">
            You may have downloaded too many files at the same time, which occupied most of the bandwidth, thus your device did not have enough bandwidth to connect to the server. If so, please stop downloading and try to re-add your device.
